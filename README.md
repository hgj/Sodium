# Sodium 2.0a Documentation

## STATUS

This project is no longer maintained and I put in no effort to continue the
developement. I've made it public anyway, as I always wanted to share my code
with the general public. Enjoy.

## Introduction

This project started as a bunch of PHP functions and classes I used for creating
sites. The code eventually made it to a small package, that I used, whenever I
started working on a new project.

As time went on, I deceided to make it better, and rewrite it to a small
framework. Sodium was a word I created as a child, when I was bored in school.
Even though I realized it is already in use, I still thought it is perfect for
my first, great project :)

Sodium reflects my style of writing PHP code, made for my personal use. It is
not a framework that wants to follow any standard rules, habits, design
principles or whatever else. It builds from my experience of coding sites and
services.

The framework aims to be very simple and fast. It is not a huge library, that
will try to define the way you code your project. It is rather a swiss army
knife with great expandability, that tries to help you when you need it. You do
not have to use the whole system, if you want to benefit from its power.
